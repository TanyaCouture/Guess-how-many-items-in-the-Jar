# Guess-how-many-items-in-the-Jar
Java Project 1: Treehouse tech degree

In this game, the user chooses the type of item to be placed in a jar. Then, the user is asked for a maximum number of this item that can be placed in the jar. The program chooses a random number of the item to fill the jar with. The user is given hints as to whether their guesses are too high or too low. When the number is guessed, a count of the number of attempts is reported.

What type of item?
